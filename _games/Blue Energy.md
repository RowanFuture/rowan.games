100000 years after the apocalypse, a mysterious entity guides you to build a factory on a desert island...

I started work on Blue Energy in 2018, at that point I was still in highschool.

For a long time it was a 2D game until I started using GameMaker to make 3D games.

Then I worked on it for around 6 months and released a demo at the same time as a Kickstarter.

At that time, thanks to playtesting I realised the concept for the game wasn't fully thought-out and the whole thing was more of a learning experience for me than a real game.

Now the game is on hold while I decide what to do with it, as I still like the artstyle and other aspects.
