I started work on Blue Energy in !!2018????!! while I was still in highschool.

For a long time it was a 2D game until I started using GameMaker to make 3D games.

Then I worked on it for around 6 months and released a demo at the same time as releasing a Kickstarter.

At that time I realised the concept for the game wasn't fully thought-out and the whole thing was more of a learning experience for me than a real game
